15 march 2011 – 15 March 2016. Five years have passed since the war started in Syria, triggering the largest refugee crisis since the Second World War.  While 7.6 million have been displaced internally and some 3.6 million people have sought refuge in neighboring countries, including [Jordan](http://www.acted.org/en/jordan-0), [Lebanon](http://www.acted.org/en/lebanon), [Iraq](http://www.acted.org/en/iraq), Turkey and beyond, 12 million people are today in need of life-saving aid inside the country. [Syria ](http://www.acted.org/en/syria)has lost nearly four decades of human development, life expectancy has been cut by an astounding 20 years, an estimated 9.8 million people are considered food insecure, and unemployment is currently over 50%. The future of an entire generation is at stake: over 13 million children are not attending school in countries being affected - either directly or indirectly - by armed conflict in the region  With livelihood opportunities devastated by the conflict, communities are left without the ability to absorb shocks or the financial means to meet their basic needs of water and food and also fuel, which in many areas have become exorbitantly expensive in the context of the crisis. With the collapse of basic public services in the country, many infrastructures are not functioning anymore to ensure proper access to basic services to the populations and avoid further displacements.  The MENA region continues to suffer from some of the most extreme and protracted humanitarian emergencies in the world. With three of the world’s four L3 emergencies, the UN’s most severe classification, tens of millions of men, women and children have been forced to flee and are in need of urgent assistance. Millions of people have been affected by violent conflict in Yemen, Syria, Iraq, occupied Palestine and Libya and remain in desperate conditions, while countless more have fled as refugees to neighbouring countries and further afield.  **A multi-country engagement**  ACTED has been supporting conflict-affected communities in Syria, Jordan, Iraq and Lebanon since 2012, supporting those directly affected by the conflict, as well as supporting the communities hosting huge numbers of refugees around the region. The teams in the field have already provided emergency assistance to over 1 million displaced people settled in camps and within host communities through camp management activities, provision of basic water and sanitation services, cash distributions, the provision of food and non-food items, agricultural inputs, trainings, protection, shelter support and youth support. In addition, ACTED has been looking towards the future and to more sustainable development, supporting the rehabilitation of local infrastructure, enhancing livelihoods and building the capacity of civil society and governance to enhance the resilience of local communities.  ACTED’s action is aimed at improving vulnerable, conflict-affected communities’ ability to meet their own basic needs by restoring sustainable livelihood opportunities, improving access to inclusive and equal basic public services, and building effective governance and civil society to contribute to early recovery efforts.  **Support across the region**  As over 630,000 Syrian refugees have fled to [Jordan](http://www.acted.org/en/jordan-0), ACTED is responding to the lifesaving humanitarian needs of the refugees in the camps and host communities, especially in Za’atari and Azraq camps. In addition to water, sanitation, food, and shelter support, ACTED is working on rehabilitating infrastructures, providing social support and engaging with civil society and government actors to mitigate the increased pressure on Jordanian public institutions, especially education and health care systems.  [Lebanon ](http://www.acted.org/en/lebanon)hosts more than a million Syrian refugees, and has demonstrated unrelenting generosity towards them. But its resilience, both economically and socially, has reached a critical point. Lebanese public services are overwhelmed and unemployment is dramatically rising. ACTED is supporting refugees and host communities to ensure basic service provision, access to water, electricity and winterization. The teams are also implementing projects to reinforce livelihoods through trainings and to strengthen humanitarian coordination.  ACTED has been working in [Iraq ](http://www.acted.org/en/iraq)since 2003 providing humanitarian support to vulnerable populations through multi-sector emergency assistance. ACTED currently operates in 5 bases (Dohuk, Erbil, Kalar, Kut and Sulaymaniyah), with a focus on emergency and sustainable works around water, sanitation and hygiene promotion; basic infrastructure; food security and NFI distribution; and integrated camp management. All of these interventions continue to provide basic and life-saving assistance to vulnerable populations, specifically Internally Displaced Persons, refugees and host communities.  **Yet, those are only punctual remedies to a crisis with no end in sight**  Until a perennial solution is found to end this conflict, ACTED is calling for all stakeholders involved to take action. Those actions should include:  - Unimpeded and sustained access for humanitarian organizations to bring immediate relief to all those in need inside Syria. - Humanitarian pauses and unconditional, monitored ceasefires to allow food and other urgent assistance to be delivered to civilians, vaccinations and other health campaigns, and for children to return to school. - A cessation of attacks on civilian infrastructure – so that schools, hospitals and water supplies are kept safe. - Freedom of movement for all civilians and the immediate lifting of all sieges by all parties.  **Whole of Syria: ACTED’s approach in 2016**  ACTED’s approach represents a fundamental shift in the way that aid is provided in Syria. The approach moves away from household-level assistance through distributions to an area-based approach where local development is co-created by communities, local governments, and supportive institutions within key sectors, with collaboration from the private sector and civil society. While ACTED acknowledges the importance household level assistance in terms of lifesaving support, it also believes there is scope to make the link between relief, rehabilitation and development (LRRD), with a strong focus on communities as a whole, rather than just the individuals within them.  ACTED therefore seeks to complement ongoing relief efforts with an approach that encompasses the community-led rehabilitation of productive infrastructure and assets combined with capacity building of Local Councils (LCs). The engagement of LCs is crucial not only to support programme implementation, but also to continue the effective provision of services post-intervention. Through this approach, ACTED is able to promote the self-sufficiency of local communities – and the households residing within them – thereby maximizing the reach of funds.

Guiding Principles <br>The earthquake and the tsunami of 26 December 2004, like many other natural disasters and displacements of population, led to the separation of large numbers of children from their parents and families. The following guiding principles should apply to their care and protection. <p>Even during these emergencies, all children have a right to a family and families have a right to care for their children. Unaccompanied and separated children should be provided with services aimed at reuniting them with their parents or customary care-givers as quickly as possible. Interim care should be consistent with the aim of family reunification, and should ensure children's protection and well-being.  <p>Experience has shown that most separated children have parents or other family members willing and able to care for them. Long-term care arrangements, including adoption, should therefore not be made during the emergency phase.  <p>However, action to help separated children does require a long-term perspective and long-term commitment on the part of the organisations involved. These organisations must also seek strong cooperation and coordination, and aim to speak with one voice. All actions should be properly coordinated with the government authorities.  <p>The following key definitions, principles and good practices form an agreed platform for partner organisations. <p>Definitions: <p><b>Separated children</b> are those separated from both parents, or from their previous legal or customary primary care-giver, but not necessarily from other relatives. These may, therefore, include children accompanied by other adult family members. <p><b>Unaccompanied children</b> are children who have been separated from both parents and other relatives and are not being cared for by an adult who, by law or custom, is responsible for doing so. <p><b>Orphans</b> are children both of whose parents are known to be dead. In some countries, however, a child who has lost one parent is called an orphan. <p>Preventing separation: <p>Organizations and authorities must ensure that their actions do not inadvertently encourage family separation. Separation can be provoked when families lack the services they need to care for their children and believe such services would be available elsewhere, or when residential child care facilities are created which may provide better services than the family is able to access.  <p>Deliberate separations can be prevented by:  <ul> <li>ensuring that all households have access to basic relief supplies and other services, including education; <br>  <li>limiting the development of residential care options, and restricting its use to those situations where it is absolutely necessary; <br>  <li>avoiding the removal of children to other countries for any reason unless critical medical care cannot be provided. This should be provided as close as possible to their home.</ul>Tracing and family reunification: <p>Identifying, registering and documenting unaccompanied and separated children are priorities in any emergency and should be carried out as quickly as possible.  <p>Registration activities should be conducted only by or under the direct supervision of Government authorities and mandated agencies with responsibility for and experience in this task;  <p>The confidential nature of the information collected must be respected and systems put in place for safe forwarding and storage of information. Information must only be shared among duly mandated agencies, for the purpose of tracing, reunification and care; <p>Tracing is the process of searching for family members or primary legal or customary care-givers. All those engaged in tracing should use the same approach, with standardized forms and mutually compatible systems;  <p>The validity of relationships and the confirmation of the willingness of the child and family member to be reunited must be verified for every child; <p>No action should be taken that may hinder eventual family reunification such as adoption, change of name, or movement to places far from the family's likely location until all tracing efforts have been exhausted.  <p>Care arrangements <p><b>Emergency care</b> <p>Care for separated children should be provided in a way that preserves family unity, including of siblings, ensures their protection and facilitates reunification. Children's security should be ensured, their basic needs adequately met, and assistance provided for their emotional support.  <ul> <li>Community care, including fostering, is preferable to institutional care, as it provides continuity in socialization and development; <br>  <li>However, children not in the care of their parents or customary caregivers may be at heightened risk of abuse and exploitation. The most appropriate carers may need extra assistance to assure children's protection and material needs are met. Provision must therefore be made for monitoring and support to foster families;  <li>For those children for whom institutional care is the only solution, centres should be small, temporary and organized around the needs of the child. It should be made very clear that the objective of residential care is reunification or placement in the community and rigorous screening procedures should be in place to ensure only appropriate admissions; <li>Removing children from familiar surroundings will increase their distress and can hinder their recovery. Children should not be removed to other countries for any reason unless critical medical care cannot be provided and then, this should be as close as possible to their home and they should be accompanied by a care-giver known to the child.</ul><b>Durable arrangements </b> <p>During the emergency period permanent care arrangements other than reunification should be avoided.  <ul> <li>Efforts to develop, and to place children in, long-term residential facilities should be discouraged;  <li>Adoption must be avoided so long as there is reasonable hope of successful tracing and reunification. </ul>Should reunification not be possible within an appropriate period, or found not to be in the child's best interests, other medium and long-term options such as foster care, group homes or adoption will need to be arranged. <ul> <li>Decisions about long term placements must be considered and decided individually for each child, in the context of national child welfare policy, legislation and practice, and corresponding to the child's best interests and his/her developmental needs. <br>  <li>At all times, children must be kept informed of the plans being made for them and their opinion taken into consideration. <br>  <li>In any form of care siblings must be kept together. <br>  <li>The provision of care should be based on the best interests of the child and should not be used to promote political, religious or other agenda. <br>  <li>Communities should be supported to play an active role in monitoring and responding to care and protection issues facing girls and boys in their local context.</ul>These provisions apply to both short and long term care arrangements.  <p>Adoption <p>Adoption, and particularly inter-country adoption, should not take place during the emergency phase.  <p>Any adoption must be determined as being in the child's best interests and carried out in keeping with applicable national, international and customary law. <p>When adoption is deemed in the child's best interest, priority must be given to adoption by relatives, wherever they live. If this is not an option, preference will be given to adoption within the community from which the child comes, or at least within his or her own culture. <p>Adoption should not be considered: <ul> <li>If there is a reasonable hope of successful tracing and reunification; <li>If it is against the expressed wishes of the child or the parents; <li>Unless a reasonable time has passed during which all feasible steps to trace the parents or other surviving family member have been carried out. </ul>Organizations wishing to work on behalf of separated children are expected to endorse these principles. 
*By Andy McElroy*  **GENEVA, 21 June 2013** - Two countries sitting at opposite ends of the world are emerging as beacons of good practice in terms of innovative public-private partnerships that have been proven to reduce disaster risk.   More than 18,000km separates New Zealand from Scotland but the two countries are much closer when it comes to pursuing proactive partnerships to strengthen the resilience of their communities and countries.   The recently released 2013 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction from the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) showcases the two countries as providing clear examples of holistic disaster risk management that moves well beyond preparedness and response.   The report, entitled Creating Shared Value: the Business Case for Disaster Risk Reduction, highlights a public-private partnership study in Christchurch, New Zealand, that prompted the city’s utilities to incorporate disaster risk management into their daily practices.   The true test, and indeed worth, of this initiative was revealed in the aftermath of the 2010 and 2011 earthquakes, which caused damage of USD4 billion and USD12 billion respectively. As a result, the Port of Littleton was able to quickly reopen, telecommunications buildings remained operational despite being damaged and most of the city’s retrofitted bridges survived intact.   Key features of the project were the wide involvement of public and private sector representatives, assessments that covered a range of hazards and a formalised coordination process through a body called the Canterbury Lifeline Utilities Group.   Similarly Orion, a local electricity distribution company, invested USD6 million in seismic strengthening that saved the company USD65 million in direct losses from earthquake damage. In contrast, residential losses were high because of a history of land-use decisions that allowed development on areas susceptible to liquefaction, lateral spreading and subsidence in the event of earthquakes.   Roger Sutton, CEO of Orion at the time of the earthquakes and now the head of the Canterbury Earthquake Authority, pinpoints the importance of effective public leadership.   As a keynote speaker at the recent 4th Global Platform on Disaster Risk Reduction in Geneva, Mr Sutton said: “Cranes and diggers are simply commodities and can be bought whereas institutions and good governance simply cannot be bought. When things turn to custard you need good governance.”  Meanwhile, in Scotland, the Global Assessment Report details how a national planning policy has reduced construction on flood plains to almost zero since 1995. The approach is founded on public-private partnerships with strong involvement of real estate developer and insurers.   Local governments, with key support from insurers, are legally obliged to set up Flood Liaison Advice Groups (FLAG) as non-statutory bodies of public and private sector representatives. The groups have attracted a remarkably wide coalition of interested parties including emergency planners, hydrology consultants to police and rail representatives. All issues relating to water management are addressed.   “The success of the initiative is undisputed. Only one local authority, Moray, did not engage and continued construction in floodplains. Consequently, it now has serious problems with flooding, and access to flood insurance,” the Global Assessment Report says.
